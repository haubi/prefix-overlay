		Tcsh is an enhanced, but completely compatible version of the
		Berkeley UNIX C shell (csh). It is a command language
		interpreter usable both as an interactive login shell and a
		shell script command processor. It includes a command-line
		editor, programmable word completion, spelling correction, a
		history mechanism, job control and a C-like syntax.

		<note version="6.14-r2">
			installation was done with double prefix, solved with
			einstall and overriding bindir and libdir.  tcsh needs, like
			other shells some special treatment with regard to the
			prefixed install it is in, since it has to fetch its
			configuration files (/etc/csh.*) from the prefix as well.
			The contents of these files also needs to reflect the
			prefix.  This is now being catered for in the ebuild.
