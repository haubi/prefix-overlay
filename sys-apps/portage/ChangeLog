  08 Oct 2006; Fabian Groffen <grobian@gentoo.org> ChangeLog:
  Rewrote QA patch from Matt, to actually work and die on double prefixed
  files. Added QA check for files installed outside the prefix, which also
  dies if it finds files.  Bumping to -r5 to force everyone using the
  new QA checks for better feedback on problem packages in the tree.

*portage-2.1.0_alpha20050718 (11 Aug 2005)

  11 Aug 2005; Marius Mauch <genone@gentoo.org>
  +portage-2.1.0_alpha20050718.ebuild:
  New pre alpha snapshot for 2.1 which is NOT the one with the new dep
  resolver, you'll have to wait for the rewrite for that. It's in the works,
  really. Meanwhile, enjoy this gapfiller. No release notes yet, so here a
  *very* short and incomplete list of new features: ebuild-daemon, elog,
  confcache, verify-rdepend, fakeroot, autotools, extended bashrc, set
  framework, transport framework. All bugreports should go to bug #102126.
  Have fun with it.
